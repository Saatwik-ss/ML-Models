# ML-Models

This project is aimed at providing simple, easy-to-understand implementations of core machine learning algorithms without relying on libraries such as sklearn, tensorflow, or pytorch, Mostly aimed as to quickly get results in most kaggle competetions with just three steps and hopefully provide an above average performance and is still very much a work in progress.

## Models Implemented
So far, I’ve implemented the following algorithms:

## 1. Logistic Regression
A statistical method for binary classification. This implementation uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function and updates the model’s weights.
The logistic sigmoid function is used to map predictions between 0 and 1, which is then used for classification.
## 2. Linear Regression
A regression algorithm that predicts a continuous target variable. This implementation uses ordinary least squares (OLS) method to find the best-fitting line and make predictions.
